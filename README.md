This application was developed on ReactJs Ignite course by RocketSeat.
I used the main React concepts to develop this app, like Components, Hooks (useState, useEffect) and
Context.
I used other resources to help in the development process, like MirageJs and Axios as our fake API.

I had a lot of fun and it helped me to increase my understanding on those important concepts of the framework.
